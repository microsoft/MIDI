DriverUnload(

    Routine Description:
        DriverUnload removes any allocated elements for the driver not handled
        by bag or WDF. Also closes off debug tracing.

    Parameters Description:

        Driver - the instance of the driver.

    Return Value:

NOTE: Consider putting globals into context and using context cleanup

DriverEntry(

    /*++

    Routine Description:
        DriverEntry initializes the driver and is the first routine called by the
        system after the driver is loaded. DriverEntry specifies the other entry
        points in the function driver, suopych as EvtDevice and DriverUnload.

    Parameters Description:

        DriverObject - represents the instance of the function driver that is loaded
        into memory. DriverEntry must initialize members of DriverObject before it
        returns to the caller. DriverObject is allocated by the system before the
        driver is loaded, and it is released by the system after the system unloads
        the function driver from memory.

        RegistryPath - represents the driver specific path in the Registry.
        The function driver can use the path to store driver related data between
        reboots. The path does not store hardware instance specific data.

    Return Value:

        STATUS_SUCCESS if successful,
        STATUS_UNSUCCESSFUL otherwise.
