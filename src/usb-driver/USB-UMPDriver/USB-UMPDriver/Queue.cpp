Routine Description:


     The I/O dispatch callbacks for the frameworks device object
     are configured in this function.

     A single default I/O Queue is configured for parallel request
     processing, and a driver context memory allocation is created
     to hold our structure QUEUE_CONTEXT.

Arguments:

    Device - Handle to a framework device object.

Return Value:

    VOID

Routine Description:

    Request - Handle to a framework request object.

    OutputBufferLength - Size of the output buffer in bytes

    InputBufferLength - Size of the input buffer in bytes

    IoControlCode - I/O control code.

Routine Description:

Arguments:

    Queue -  Handle to the framework queue object that is associated with the

    Request - Handle to a framework request object.

    ActionFlags - A bitwise OR of one or more WDF_REQUEST_STOP_ACTION_FLAGS-typed flags
                  that identify the reason that the callback function is being called
                  and whether the request is cancelable.

    //
    // In most cases, the EvtIoStop callback function completes, cancels, or postpones
    // further processing of the I/O request.
    //
    // Typically, the driver uses the following rules:
    //
    // - If the driver owns the I/O request, it either postpones further processing
    //   of the request and calls WdfRequestStopAcknowledge, or it calls WdfRequestComplete
    //   with a completion status value of STATUS_SUCCESS or STATUS_CANCELLED.
    //  
    //   The driver must call WdfRequestComplete only once, to either complete or cancel
    //   the request. To ensure that another thread does not call WdfRequestComplete
    //   for the same request, the EvtIoStop callback must synchronize with the driver's
    //   other event callback functions, for instance by using interlocked operations.
    //
    // - If the driver has forwarded the I/O request to an I/O target, it either calls
    //   WdfRequestCancelSentRequest to attempt to cancel the request, or it postpones
    //   further processing of the request and calls WdfRequestStopAcknowledge.
    //
    // A driver might choose to take no action in EvtIoStop for requests that are
    // guaranteed to complete in a small amount of time. For example, the driver might
    // take no action for requests that are completed in one of the driver’s request handlers.
