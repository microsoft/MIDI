# Windows MIDI Services

This project is the next-generation MIDI API for Windows, including MIDI 1.0 and MIDI 2.0 (MIDI CI, and MIDI 2.0 UMP). It includes enhancements, a new USB class driver, new transports, and essential tools. The project adds many enhancements and bug fixes to our MIDI 1.0 support, and importantly adds support for the latest revisions to MIDI 2.0 as approved by The MIDI Association.
