Modified from this project
https://github.com/MaySoMusician/NodeRT/tree/feature/136-vs2019

Assuming you have winget installed

winget install nodejs
or download from https://nodejs.org/en

npm install npm@latest -g

npm install node-gyp -g

in windows environment variables (so they are global)
LIBPATH = C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\UnionMetadata\10.0.20348.0

npm config edit
	add a line which says:
	msvs_version=2022


nodert\src\NodeRTCmd\bin\Debug\NodeRTCmd.exe --winmd ..\Windows.Devices.Midi2.winmd --outdir .\projection

In VS C++ project, for all configurations, update the AdditionalUsingDirectories property to include
%Program Files (x86)%\Windows Kits\10\UnionMetadata\10.0.20348.0

copy Windows.Devices.Midi2.winmd to projection\windows.devices.midi2\build
copy Windows.winmd from the unionmetadata to same folder

copy C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\Preview\Common7\IDE\VC\vcpackages platform.winmd to same folder


Comment out SendMessageStruct body and reference

Open binding.sln in VS and recompile in BOTH debug and release


binding.gyp

      ["WIN_VER==\"v10\"", {
        "msvs_settings": {
          "VCCLCompilerTool": {
            "AdditionalUsingDirectories": [
              "%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/lib/store/references",
              "%ProgramFiles%/Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0/VC/lib/store/references",
              "%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Windows Kits/10/UnionMetadata/10.0.20348.0",
              "$(VCToolsInstallDir)/lib/x86/store/references",
              "%MIDI_REPO_ROOT%/build/release/api/"
            ]
          }
        }
      }],


download 
npm pack @nodert-win11/windows.data.json
npm pack @nodert-win11/windows.devices.midi
npm pack @nodert-win11/windows.devices.enumeration

unzip them, copy to appropriate folders under node_modules, and then make these changes:

 (this change needs to be made in binding.gyp in ALL downloaded packages as well or you need to download and install 10.0.22000 sdk, or whatever version the binding.gyp specifies)

      ["USE_ADDITIONAL_WINMD==\"true\"", {
        "msvs_settings": {
          "VCCLCompilerTool": {
            "AdditionalUsingDirectories": [
              "%ProgramFiles%/Windows Kits/10/UnionMetadata/10.0.20348.0",
              "%ProgramFiles%/Windows Kits/10/Include/10.0.20348.0/um",
              "%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Windows Kits/10/UnionMetadata/10.0.20348.0",
              "%ProgramFiles(x86)%/Windows Kits/10/Include/10.0.20348.0/um"
            ]
          }
        }
      }]



copy windows.devices.midi2 folder from projection to node_modules in sample

To deal with mismatch node_module versions:

in projection windows.devices.midi2 folder:
npm install --save-dev electron
npm install --save-dev @electron/rebuild
node_modules\.bin\electron-rebuild

Then do the same for each app. After the npm install commands, you'll need to re-copy the windows.devices.midi2 folder into node_modules

from electron-midi-sample folder
npm start to run
