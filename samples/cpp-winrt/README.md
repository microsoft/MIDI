# Using Windows MIDI Services from C++ / WinRT

It's expected that C++/WinRT is the primary way developers will use this API and SDK. Unlike the older C++/CX ir WRL, C++/WinRT is based on C++ 17 language standards and is implemented as NuGet packages and standard C++ headers.

> From docs:
>C++/WinRT is the recommended alternative to C++/CX. It is a new, standard C++17 language projection for Windows Runtime APIs, available in the latest Windows SDK from version 1803 (10.0.17134.0) onward. C++/WinRT is implemented entirely in header files, and designed to provide you with first-class access to the modern Windows API.
>
> With C++/WinRT, you can both consume and author Windows Runtime APIs using any standards-conformant C++17 compiler. C++/WinRT typically performs better and produces smaller binaries than any other language option for the Windows Runtime. We will continue to support C++/CX and WRL, but highly recommend that new applications use C++/WinRT. For more information, see C++/WinRT.

For C++, Windows MIDI Services is only being tested with C++/WinRT, not CX or WRL, but those will likely still work.

## Samples

| Sample | Description |
| -------| ----------- |
| [Full Init](full-init/) | Shows complete end-to-end of detecting Windows MIDI Services, downloading missing bits, and initializing the SDK. |
| [App SDK Basics](basics/) | Shows how to open a MidiSession, and connect to a MidiEndpoint to send and receive messages|
| [Enumerate Endpoints](static-enum-endpoints/) | Demonstrates enumerating endpoints, getting group terminal and function blocks, and other properties|
| [Loopback Endpoints](loopback-endpoints/) | Demonstrates how to create simple loopback endpoints at runtime.|
| [Simple app-to-app MIDI](simple-app-to-app-midi/) | Demonstrates how to create an application endpoint, and update properties like function blocks. The C# sample is more of a real-world use-case.|
| [Static Enum Endpoints](static-enum-endpoints/) | Demonstrates how to get a one-time static list of active endpoints.|
| [Watch Endpoints](watch-endpoints/) | Demonstrates handling device add/remove notifications, as well as device property changes. Most applications will want to use the watcher so they can properly react to device plug/unplug, as well as things like Function Block updates.|

We recommend you load the entire solution in Visual Studio, as that is how the NuGet package configuration is set up. Change the sample you run by setting that project as startup.

Before running, you will need to have installed the Windows MIDI Services App SDK Runtime. You will also need the NuGet package that these projects use, in a location on your PC configured as a NuGet package source. The runtime and NuGet package are available in the official releases.
