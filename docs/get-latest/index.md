## System Requirements

> Please see current release notes for any system requirements.

The **Windows MIDI Services runtime and tools** requires Windows 11 with the Windows MIDI Service, plugins, and USB driver pre-installed from Microsoft.

The **Windows MIDI Services preview service and plugins** for developers requires Windows 11 with Developer Mode switched on in the Windows Settings app. For use with MIDI 2.0 devices, the service and plugins must be installed on a version of Windows which already has the MIDI 2.0 driver and USB stack enhancements in-place. 

Any preview transport plugins, such as the Network MIDI 2.0 Service plugin, require an existing working Windows MIDI Services installation, as well as Developer Mode switched on in the Windows Settings app.
