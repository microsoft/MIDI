description: How to get help in the Windows MIDI Services Console
---

Add the option `--help` or its short version `-h` to any command to get information and examples for that command.

```
midi --help
midi service --help
midi enumerate --help
midi enumerate endpoints --help
```

The `--help` option will always provide the most up-to-date list of commands and options supported by the MIDI Services Console.

## Check the MIDI Service Health

The heart of Windows MIDI Services is the Windows Service which processes and routes messages, creates endpoints, and more. The MIDI Services Console app includes a few commands to check the status and health of the service.

### Check MIDI Service Status

If you want to verify that the MIDI Service is running, you can check its status using the Service Control Manager, or through the MIDI Console. 

```
midi service status
midi svc status
```

If you uset the `--verbose` or `-v` option, the console will display more information about the service.

```
midi service status
midi svc status
```

### Ping the Service

If you want to verify that the service is transmitting and receiving messages, you can use the ping command, much like you would 

```
midi service ping
midi svc ping
```

This command also supports the `--verbose` or `-v` option to display the full results of the ping. It also supports a `--count` or `-c` parameter for the number of messages you want to send. Finally, the call supports a `--timeout` or `-t` parameter to set the timeout in milliseconds before the ping is considered to have failed.

Here are examples of the command with various parameters.

```
midi service ping --verbose
midi service ping --verbose --count 20 --timeout 20000
```

### Stop / Start / Restart the Service

The MIDI console has three commands for managing the Windows service. These can be useful when developing or debugging service-side plugins. Note that these must be run from an Administrator console session.

```
midi service stop
midi service start
midi service restart
```

> Tip: You can use the new Windows `sudo` command if you are a developer and you have enabled it in the Windows 11 developer settings.

```
sudo midi service restart
```
